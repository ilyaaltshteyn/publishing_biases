  * Nature Comment article
  * Great lit review of research on the topic
  * Strong, global analysis of patterns of authorship and citation counts
    * Still suffers from the base rates problem, I THINK (i'm tired, read again in the morning)!!

  * They do first author female vs overall proportion in population
    * This is pretty good, but not as clean as first vs last
    * They don't do the analysis over time well
  * Do network analysis to split papers into fields and look into papers by field
  * Create an interactive tool to explore some of the data
  * Claim that "From 1990 to present, women are no longer severely underrepresented
    as first author, but they are increasingly underrepresented as last author"
      * I doubt the "1990" part of this claim, considering my results

Jagsi, Reshma, et al. "The “gender gap” in authorship of academic medical literature—a 35-year perspective." New England Journal of Medicine 355.3 (2006): 281-287.

  * Medicine only
  * Look mostly at trends over time in % women (base rates only)
    * % in first auth, last auth, grad student and professorship.
  * Look only at first vs last authorship, which is affected by the base rate of
    women in academia.
      * So this paper isn't really about discovering bias.

  * Very similar to Jagsi, Reshma et al, 2006.

A gender gap in the dermatology literature? Cross-sectional analysis of manuscript authorship trends in dermatology journals during 3 decades
Jamison D. Feramisco, MD, PhD, Justin J. Leitenberger, BS, Shelley I. Redfern, BS, Aihua Bian, MPH, Xian-Jin Xie, PhD, Jack S. Resneck Jr., MD. 2009

  * "Female dermatologists are authoring publications in growing numbers that match
    or exceed their prevalence in the academic and overall workforce."
  * Dermatology journals only
  * Another base rates only paper.

Scientific authorship: Credit and intellectual property in science

There's nothing in here about gender as far as I can tell from the preview, but
lots of interesting anthropology in there.

Gender-specific patterns in patenting and publishing
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2009.01.019

This talks about who is most likely to get denied authorship.

Claim that female scientists patent less than male scientists with similar publication records, based on these references:
(Breschi et al., 2005; Azoulay et al., 2007;
Stephan et al., 2007; see also Whittington and Smith-Doerr, 2008).
"This may be explained by Ding et al.’s (2006) and Murray and Graham’s (2007) analysis of longitudinal data on careers and field interviews, which show that women have fewer connections to operators in the marketplace than men. This diminishes their opportunities to commercialize their research results or to cash in their reputation through consultancy or participation in high-tech companies." page 52-53

Gender and Commercial Science: Women’s Patenting in the Life Sciences
http://www.reed.edu/sociology/faculty/whittington/docs/Whittington_SmithDoerr_JTT.pdf

"There is remarkable similarity between men and
women in average inventor sequence. As Table 1
shows, there is no significant difference between
the average inventor sequence of female and male
scientists. The average male and female scientist in
this sample is at the 2.2 and 2.5 position in the
inventor sequence, respectively. There are no
gender differences across employment sectors, and
no clear increasing or decreasing trends among the
sexes over time. On this measure, men and women
who are already involved in patenting remain
remarkably similar." page 361

The Academic Advantage: Gender Disparities in Patenting
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128000

Shows that women's patenting rate has increased over the past ~50 years, and demonstrates the effect across different professional contexts (academia vs industry vs government).

Investigate the scope and causes of the gender gap in patenting among life scientists.
Use a longitudinal approach to look at 4k+ scientists' patenting patterns.
