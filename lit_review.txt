  * Nature Comment article
  * Great lit review of research on the topic
  * Strong, global analysis of patterns of authorship and citation counts
    * Still suffers from the base rates problem, I THINK (i'm tired, read again in the morning)!!

  * They do first author female vs overall proportion in population
    * This is pretty good, but not as clean as first vs last
    * They don't do the analysis over time well
  * Do network analysis to split papers into fields and look into papers by field
  * Create an interactive tool to explore some of the data
  * Claim that "From 1990 to present, women are no longer severely underrepresented
    as first author, but they are increasingly underrepresented as last author"
      * I doubt the "1990" part of this claim, considering my results

Jagsi, Reshma, et al. "The “gender gap” in authorship of academic medical literature—a 35-year perspective." New England Journal of Medicine 355.3 (2006): 281-287.

  * Medicine only
  * Look mostly at trends over time in % women (base rates only)
    * % in first auth, last auth, grad student and professorship.
  * Look only at first vs last authorship, which is affected by the base rate of
    women in academia.
      * So this paper isn't really about discovering bias.

  * Very similar to Jagsi, Reshma et al, 2006.

A gender gap in the dermatology literature? Cross-sectional analysis of manuscript authorship trends in dermatology journals during 3 decades
Jamison D. Feramisco, MD, PhD, Justin J. Leitenberger, BS, Shelley I. Redfern, BS, Aihua Bian, MPH, Xian-Jin Xie, PhD, Jack S. Resneck Jr., MD. 2009

  * "Female dermatologists are authoring publications in growing numbers that match
    or exceed their prevalence in the academic and overall workforce."
  * Dermatology journals only
  * Another base rates only paper.
-------
Ideas for own project:

1. Do not focus on absolute rates of authorship by women.
  * Can be a secondary statistic.
  * Emphasize this lack of focus, and an interest in documenting bias.
2.
