* Key 'author' has a list of authors.
  * For each one, there might be
    1. An affiliation, under 'affiliation'
    2. A last name, under 'family'
    3. A first name, under 'given'
      - These are often just abbreviations
* Key 'issued' has the earliest known publication date, whether online or in print
* Key 'published-print' has the in-print publication date
* Key 'published-online' has the online publication date
* Key 'container-title' has the "Work container title, such as journal title, or book title"
* Key 'publisher' contains a higher level publisher info than 'container-title'
* Key 'subject' has info about the subject of the paper
* Key 'title' has the title of the work
* Key 'type' is 'journal-article' or 'book-chapter'

One possible strategy to tag everything:

1. Get a cursor to point at all records that don't have the field "author-genders"
2. Loop through the cursor and pull author names list
3. Analyze first name for each author, and add result to "author-genders" list
  - Result should be non-binary
    * Male, mostly-male, mostly-female, female, unknown-estimation_failure,
      unknown-no_first_name, unknown-too_short_or_initials, unknown-code_failure
4. Query to get all "author-genders" lists
